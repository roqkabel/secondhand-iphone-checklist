# iPhone secondhand checklist webtool

## Problematic to solve:
Each time I buy a new, used iPhone, I want to run some tests to verify if I will have a good purchase.
So I built this checklist to run these tests. 
I avoided developing an App since it requires installation and connecting to iCloud, which is not convenient when purchasing a new phone.
